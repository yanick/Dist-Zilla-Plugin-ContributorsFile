NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ContributorsFile - add a file listing all
    contributors

VERSION
    version 0.3.0

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

        " any plugin populating x_contributors in the META files
        [Git::Contributors]

        [ContributorsFile]
        filename = CONTRIBUTORS

DESCRIPTION
    "Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ContributorsFile" populates a *CONTRIBUTORS* file
    with all the contributors of the project as found under the
    *x_contributors* key in the META files.

    The generated file will look like this:

        # FOO-BAR CONTRIBUTORS #

        This is the (likely incomplete) list of people who have helped
        make this distribution what it is, either via code contributions, 
        patches, bug reports, help with troubleshooting, etc. A huge
        'thank you' to all of them.

            * Albert Zoot
            * Bertrand Maxwell

    Note that if no contributors beside the actual author(s) are found, the
    file will not be created.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
  filename
    The name of the contributor file that is created. Defaults to
    *CONTRIBUTORS*.

TRICKS
    Refer to David Golden's blog entry at
    <http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/1921/how-im-using-distzilla-to-give-c
    redit-to-contributors/> to get introduced to the "Dist::Zilla"
    contributor modules.

    Git's ".mailmap" file is useful to deal with contributors with several
    email addresses:
    <https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-shortlog.html>.

    To give credit to bug reporters and other persons who don't commit code
    directly, you can use empty git commits:

        git commit --allow-empty --author="David Golden <dagolden@cpan.org>" -m "..."

    To populate the META file with the "x_contributors", you probably want
    to use either Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::Contributors or
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ContributorsFromGit.
